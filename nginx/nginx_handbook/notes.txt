-developed because of apache concurrency problems
-mitigates this issue by spawning worker processes of which each can handle thousands of connections.
-decoupling actual work from connectionajd allow itself with a connection only when a new event has been 
triggered
-faster in static content delivery while staying relatively lighter on resources because it doesnt embed a 
dynamic programming language
-if dynamic programming language required, then nginx delegates the tasks to separate processes as php-fpm
or node.js or python that responses back to the client
    
-simple directive are terminated by semicolons like listen, return etc
-block directives end with curly braces {} 
-block directive capable of containing other directives inside is called a context like events, https etc
    -events{} context is usef for setting global configuration ofor handling requests on a general level
    -http{} context is used to handle http and https requests.
    -server{} context is inside http which is used for configuring virtual servers within a single host.
        -one server = one virtual host
    -main{} anything not written in above is written in main.. idk what this means!!!

-/srv directory is meant to contain site-specific data which is served by this system
-root directive is used to point the site specific directory which is inside /srv directory
-types directive is used for configuring file type like plaintext, html and css
-include directive allows us to include content from other configuration file like mime.types 
-location mantches any uri starting with agatha 
    -ie. http://nginx-handbook.test/agatha and http://nginx-handbook.test/agatha-christie gives same responses
    -also calle prefix mantches
-location = performs exact matche i.e. /agatha and /agatha-christie does not respond the same 
-location ~ to perform regex match and is case sensitive
-location ~* to make it case insensitive
-set directive used for declaring new variables

-redirect: url changes from /about_page to about.htm 
-rewrite: url does not change but content changes to about.html
-try_files displays the files (if exists) and displays error msg if does not exist and does not display the 
    actual page 
-try_files using $uri solves the above problem by displaying the index at first and if the request file 
    does not exit then only displays the error message but problem: the url server root returns error
-try_files $uri $uri/ solves this error by searching for the uri first and if not found then search 
    requested uri as a directory

-access_log <path> or off or / directive logs into the file metnioned in the <path>, not log, default resp.
-error, crit, alert, emerg: are the error msgs thats needs to be addressed
    Reverse Proxy: 
        -(nginx)sits in between client and backend and therefore directs requests send by client
    to appropriate backend server which ensures the smooth flow of network traffic.
        -can be used as a load balancer, increased security(through ssl and protection for backend server)
    Difference between a proxy and a reverse proxy:
        -proxy sits in front of client but reverse proxy sits in front of servers
        -its like proxy acts like a protection for clients whereas reverse proxy acts as a protection for
        backend server

-proxy_http_version directive sets the http version for the server
-proxy_set_header directive is used for setting a header on the backend 
    -proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade  passes the value of the $http_pugrade variable as a header 
    named Upgrade

    php project
    -index index.php: uses indes.php file as root
    -fastcgi_param REQUEST_METHOD $request_method; passes the request method to the back-end
    -fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $realpath_root$fastcgi_script_name; line passes the exact location of
     the PHP script to run.

     loadbalancer
-upstream context is used for collecting a group of backend server and treat them as a singly entity
-proxy_pass directive is used to point to the upstream context(as a whole) and nginx will balance the load
-master process: to read and evaluate configuration and maintain worker processes.
-worker_process: responsible for actual processing for requests
    -this directive is written in the main context and is responsible for setting the number of worker
processes to spawn
-worker_connection: highest no. of connections a single worker process can handle
    -no. of files O.S. is allowed to open per core 
    -ulimit -n
